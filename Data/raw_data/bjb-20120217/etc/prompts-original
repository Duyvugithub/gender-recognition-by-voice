vf31-01 No sooner said than done the two mice set off for the town 
vf31-02 and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night. 
vf31-03 You will want some refreshment after our long journey, 
vf31-04 said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room. 
vf31-05 There they found the remains of a fine feast, 
vf31-06 and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice. 
vf31-07 Suddenly they heard growling and barking. 
vf31-08 What is that? said the Country Mouse. 
vf31-09 It is only the dogs of the house, answered the other. 
vf31-10 Only! said the Country Mouse. I do not like that music at my dinner. 
vf31-11 Just at that moment the door flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, 
vf31-12 and the two mice had to scamper down and run off. 
vf31-13 Good-bye, Cousin, said the Country Mouse, What! going so soon?
vf31-14 said the other. Yes, he replied; Better beans and bacon in peace 
vf31-15 than cakes and ale in fear
vf31-16 a Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese 
vf31-17 in its beak and settle on a branch of a tree.   
vf31-18 That's for me, as I am a Fox, said Master Reynard,   
vf31-19 and he walked up to the foot of the tree.   
vf31-20 Good-day, Mistress Crow, he cried.   
vf31-21 How well you are looking today how glossy your feathers; how bright your eye.   
vf31-22 I feel sure your voice must surpass that of other birds, just as your figure does;   
vf31-23 let me hear but one song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds.   
vf31-24 The Crow lifted up her head and began to caw her best,   
vf31-25 but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground,   
vf31-26 only to be snapped up by Master Fox.   
vf31-27 That will do, said he. That was all I wanted.   
vf31-28 In exchange for your cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the future.   
vf31-29 Do not trust flatterers 
vf31-30 a Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death 
vf31-31 at the mouth of his cave, gasping for breath.   
vf31-32 The animals, his subjects, came round him and drew nearer 
vf31-33 as he grew more and more helpless.   
vf31-34 When they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves   
vf31-35 Now is the time to pay off old grudges.   
vf31-36 So the Boar came up and drove at him with his tusks;   
vf31-37 then a Bull gored him with his horns;   
vf31-38 still the Lion lay helpless before them   
vf31-39 so the Ass, feeling quite safe from danger, 
vf31-40 came up, and turning his tail to the Lion   
vf31-41 kicked up his heels into his face.   
vf31-42 This is a double death, growled the Lion.   
vf31-43 Only cowards insult dying majesty
