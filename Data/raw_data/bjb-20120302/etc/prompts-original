vf6-01 He cried, and swung the club wildly 
vf6-02 She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face 
vf6-03 They were following the shore of a lake 
vf6-04 The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him 
vf6-05 From now on we're pals 
vf6-06 He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau 
vf6-07 How much was it 
vf6-08 Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression 
vf6-09 It was not a large lake, and almost round 
vf6-10 Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards 
vf6-11 It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made 
vf6-12 Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman 
vf6-13 Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound 
vf6-14 Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head 
vf6-15 They die out of spite 
vf6-16 The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him 
vf6-17 Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive 
vf6-18 The ringing of the big bell aroused him 
vf6-19 At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened 
vf6-20 A dead man is of no use on a plantation
vf6-21 I don't know why you're here at all 
vf6-22 What part of the United States is your home 
vf6-23 My, I'm almost homesick for it already 
vf6-24 She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist 
vf6-25 I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up 
vf6-26 That came before my A B C's 
vf6-27 It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles 
vf6-28 But it contributed to the smash 
vf6-29 The last one I knew was an overseer 
vf6-30 Do you know any good land around here 
vf6-31 The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia 
vf6-32 I cannot follow you, she said 
vf6-33 I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me 
vf6-34 Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil 
vf6-35 His voice was passionately rebellious 
vf6-36 Don't you see I hate you 
vf6-37 So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves 
vf6-38 It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon 
vf6-39 He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter 
vf6-40 Wash your hands of me
