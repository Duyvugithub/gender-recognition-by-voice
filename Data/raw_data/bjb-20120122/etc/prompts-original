vf-22-01 And he did hurt my arm
vf-22-02 Saxon's onto her job
vf-22-03 Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another
vf-22-04 But this time it was Saxon who rebelled
vf-22-05 I was not to cry out in the face of fear
vf-22-06 And now put yourself in my place for a moment
vf-22-07 The boy threw back his head with pride
vf-22-08 Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned
vf-22-09 Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot
vf-22-10 We could throw stones with our feet
vf-22-11 It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way
vf-22-12 These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter
vf-22-13 Then it was that a strange thing happened
vf-22-14 From the source of light a harsh voice said
vf-22-15 But I did not enjoy it long
vf-22-16 We were now good friends
vf-22-17 Two of the Folk were already up
vf-22-18 Now animals do not like mockery
vf-22-19 He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees
vf-22-20 Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried
vf-22-21 Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion
vf-22-22 Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured
vf-22-23 But we were without this momentum
vf-22-24 There was one difficulty, however
vf-22-25 The hyena proceeded to dine
vf-22-26 The time was considered auspicious
vf-22-27 Or have they already devised one
vf-22-28 We would not spend another such night
vf-22-29 At first his progress was slow and erratic
vf-22-30 He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated
vf-22-31 The awe of man rushed over him again
vf-22-32 The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders
vf-22-33 Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities
vf-22-34 For a much longer time Lop-Ear and I remained and watched
vf-22-35 All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret
vf-22-36 At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style
vf-22-37 Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round
vf-22-38 His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-Leg by the neck
vf-22-39 Miss Brodie's smile was slightly sarcastic
vf-22-40 Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way
