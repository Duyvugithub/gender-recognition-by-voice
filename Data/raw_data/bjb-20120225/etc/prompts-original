vf4-01 They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours 
vf4-02 Two years ago I gave up civilization for this 
vf4-03 She had died from cold and starvation 
vf4-04 It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks 
vf4-05 He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself 
vf4-06 Each day she became a more vital part of him 
vf4-07 It was a temptation, but he resisted it 
vf4-08 This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born 
vf4-09 Her face was against his breast 
vf4-10 She was his now, forever 
vf4-11 Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom 
vf4-12 A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips 
vf4-13 Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength 
vf4-14 He obeyed the pressure of her hand 
vf4-15 I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre 
vf4-16 About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age 
vf4-17 Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure 
vf4-18 In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne 
vf4-19 He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes 
vf4-20 Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this
vf4-21 It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God 
vf4-22 Such things had occurred before, he told Philip 
vf4-23 Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed 
vf4-24 But there was something even more startling than this resemblance 
vf4-25 I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily 
vf4-26 Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued 
vf4-27 A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness 
vf4-28 Now these things had been struck dead within him 
vf4-29 For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky 
vf4-30 Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted 
vf4-31 And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare 
vf4-32 Philip thrust himself against it and entered 
vf4-33 MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger 
vf4-34 He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black 
vf4-35 Won't you draw up, gentlemen 
vf4-36 A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned 
vf4-37 He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice 
vf4-38 Does that look good 
vf4-39 They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life 
vf4-40 You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt
