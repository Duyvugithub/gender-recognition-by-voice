vf2-01 Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell 
vf2-02 How could he explain his possession of the sketch 
vf2-03 It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson 
vf2-04 Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip 
vf2-05 He moved away as quietly as he had come 
vf2-06 The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear 
vf2-07 Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog 
vf2-08 He looked at the handkerchief more, closely 
vf2-09 Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin 
vf2-10 In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously 
vf2-11 The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow 
vf2-12 It was a curious coincidence 
vf2-13 Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief 
vf2-14 There was nothing on the rock 
vf2-15 Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound 
vf2-16 Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly 
vf2-17 I have no idea, replied Philip 
vf2-18 I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else 
vf2-19 His immaculate appearance was gone 
vf2-20 Anyway, no one saw her like that
vf2-21 Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him 
vf2-22 The men stared into each other's face 
vf2-23 Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger 
vf2-24 The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments 
vf2-25 They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel 
vf2-26 He saw Jeanne falter for a moment 
vf2-27 Surely I will excuse you, she cried 
vf2-28 In a flash Philip followed its direction 
vf2-29 It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father 
vf2-30 He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there 
vf2-31 What was the object of your little sensation 
vf2-32 But who was Eileen's double 
vf2-33 The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them 
vf2-34 And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him 
vf2-35 There has been a change, she interrupted him 
vf2-36 The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened 
vf2-37 It is the fire, partly, she said 
vf2-38 Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her 
vf2-39 It was a large canoe 
vf2-40 What if Jeanne failed him
