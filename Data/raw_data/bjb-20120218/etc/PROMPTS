bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-08 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-09 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE

bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-11 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-12 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-13 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE

bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-16 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE-SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-17 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-18 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-19 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-20 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-21 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-22 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-23 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-24 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-25 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-26 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-27 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-28 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-29 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-30 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-31 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-32 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-33 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-34 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-35 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-36 SHE TURNED IN AT THE HOTEL
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-37 I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMAINED SITTING
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-38 WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUR CHANCES
bjb-20120218/mfc/vf1-39 THE SHIP SHOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
